# OpenMP-Multithread-Framework
3 sequential algorithm (simplex, game-of-life and heatmap) were sped up using different number of threads.

Full specification of those algorithms and constraints about their speeding up can be seen [here](https://github.com/mdodovic/OpenMP-Multithread-Framework/blob/main/problems_description.pdf).

## [task1](https://github.com/mdodovic/OpenMP-Multithread-Framework/tree/main/task1_simplex)

Sequential code is modified and then both basic and modified codes are sped up using **manual scheduling** of all unit-of-works.
